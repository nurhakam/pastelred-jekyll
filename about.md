Hey there! My name is Hakam. This site is my personal blog. Sometimes I will post some of my thoughts here and I hope you enjoy reading it.

I am a student, I seek anything to learn and experience, in a world that isn't centered around, far-far away from my own corner, to the other, the unknown. What for? to find myself. 

## Goals & Interests
- Being storyteller
- Traveling around the world
- Reduce environmental and social problems
- Read books with beautiful story
- Watch good and entertaining movies
- Enjoy anime a lot
- Sometimes plays games too
- Love listening to music

This site will always under construction.

Thanks for coming, fam!
